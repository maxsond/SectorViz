# Welcome to Sector Viz!

## What is Sector Viz?

Sector Viz is a WebGL 3D visualizer for stellar sectors generated by the excellent 
[Sectors Without Number](https://sectorswithoutnumber.com) tool for the phenomenal 
[Stars Without Number](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/230009/Stars-Without-Number-Revised-Edition-Free-Version) 
tabletop roleplaying game.

## How Do I Use It?

See the [about](about) page for detailed instructions with pictures.

## It's Missing A Lot

Oh, I almost forgot to mention this is just a **prototype** to convey the direction 
that I'm going with the project. I'm not considering it done until it can display everything that the
Stars Without Number rules are capable of generating (yes, that includes characters).
My first goal, though, is parity with the Sectors Without Number generator.

## Do You Have A Roadmap?

Check out my [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/x3yliUXM/swn-unity) to see what I have in mind next and what
I'm currently working on. It's a short list because I don't believe in long backlogs so I just maintain a list of
the next few things I intend to work on. But if you don't see something there that you think should be, I invite you to 
[make a Github issue](https://github.com/maxsond/SectorViz/issues/new).

## Will You Support Mobile?

I'm developing with mobile support in the back of my mind, but I'm not experienced in mobile support
so it might not work quite right for now (heck, it doesn't even work quite right on PC at the moment).
This is something I'm interested in learning as I go, though, so... maybe? Probably?

## Where Can I Leave Feedback?
I would love to hear people's feedback. What works? What doesn't? What's your most wished for next feature?
Feel free to [make a Github issue](https://github.com/maxsond/SectorViz/issues/new). Please use the "feedback"
label for opinions, and other labels as appropriate.
